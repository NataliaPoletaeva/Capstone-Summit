                <p>Water pollution is one of the most important issues for all the nations, due to
                    its
                    impact on the human life and economic activity. Thus, maintaining the water quality for the present
                    and
                    future generations must be a priority for all the people and the decision factors, as well.</p>
                <p class="hide">We expect that the research presented in this special session will answer
                    the
                    following questions: How
                    to better monitor the water quality? Are the present indicators of water quality good enough to
                    emphasize the water quality or could they be improved and how? Which measures can be proposed based
                    on
                    some given indicators, to improve the water quality? Which green methods could be used for cleaning
                    the
                    water?</p>
                <p class="hide">We hope to come to the solutions for some of these questions and plan out
